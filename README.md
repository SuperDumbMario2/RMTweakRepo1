# SDM2's Tweak Repository
Repository with my own "SM64 ROM Manager" tweaks for rom-hacking.
Please credit me for using those.
# Contents:
Beta Models.json - Installs hex-codes from TCRF, to install unused models to sm64 rom
Remove Chain Chomp's Log.json - entriely by me. Removes the log, that Chain Chomp is attached to, results into him looking like in the beta.

# SDM2's Tweak Repository
Repository with my own "SM64 ROM Manager" tweaks for rom-hacking.

Please credit me for using those.
# Contents:
Beta Models.json - Installs hex-codes from TCRF, to install unused models to sm64 rom

Remove Chain Chomp's Log.json - entriely by me. Removes the log, that Chain Chomp is attached to, results into it looking like in the beta.

Black Fadeout on Title Screen and File Select Screen..json - entriely by me too. Makes the fade-out in title screen, file select, and star select black, like in beta. If you skipped level select in past re-patch the level select screen skip patch or the game will crash after pressing start on mario screen.
